        <h1>WHY?</h1>
        My favorite Sonic Game on this website.I had a very hard time choosing the game that goes  
        onto this website.Sonic Mania is on of my favorites.Not only of the graphics but the music aswell 
        the graphics are colourful and the game mechanics are impressive aswell. the movement is easy and the 
        controls are understandable. i like this genre of games and sonic is always my number one game.
